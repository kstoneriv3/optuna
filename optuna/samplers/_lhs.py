class QMCSampler(BaseSampler):
    """A Quasi Monte Carlo Sampler that generates low-discrepancy sequences.

    Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) sequences are designed to have lower discrepancies than
    standard random seqeunces. They are known to perform better than the standard
    randam sequences in hyperparameter optimization.

    For further information about the use of QMC sequences for hyperparameter optimization,
    please refer to the following paper:

    - Bergstra, James, and Yoshua Bengio. Random search for hyper-parameter optimization.
      Journal of machine learning research 13.2, 2012.
      <https://jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html>`_

    We use the QMC implementations in Scipy. For the details of the QMC algorithm,
    see the Scipy API references on `scipy.stats.qmc
    <https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/stats.qmc.html>`_.

    .. note:
        If your search space contains categorical parameters, it samples the catagorical
        parameters by its `independent_sampler` without using QMC algorithm.

    Args:
        qmc_type:
            The type of QMC sequence to be sampled. This must be one of
            `"halton"` and `"sobol"`. Default is `"halton"`.

            .. note:
                Sobol sequence is designed to have low-discrepancy property when the number of
                samples is :math:`n=2^m` for each positive integer :math:`m`. When it is possible
                to pre-specify the number of trials suggested by `QMCSampler`, it is recommended
                that the number of trials should be set as power of two.

        scramble:
            In cases ``qmc_type`` is `"halton"` or `"sobol"`, if this option is :obj:`True`,
            scrambling (randomization) is applied to the QMC sequences.

        seed:
            A seed for `QMCSampler`. When the ``qmc_type`` is `"halton"` or `"sobol"`,
            this argument is used only when `scramble` is :obj:`True`. If this is :obj:`None`,
            the seed is initialized randomly. Default is :obj:`None`.

            .. note::
                When using multiple :class:`~optuna.samplers.QMCSampler`'s in parallel and/or
                distributed optimization, all the samplers must share the same seed when the
                `scrambling` is enabled. Otherwise, the low-discrepancy property of the samples
                will be degraded.

        search_space:
            The search space of the sampler.

            If this argument is not provided and there are prior
            trials in the study, :class:`~optuna.samplers.QMCSamper` infers its search space using
            the first trial of the study.

            If this argument if not provided and the study has no
            prior trials, :class:`~optuna.samplers.QMCSampler` samples the first trial using its
            `_independent_sampler` and then infers the search space in the second trial.

            .. note::
                As mentioned above, the search space of the :class:`~optuna.sampler.QMCSampler` is
                determined by argument ``search_space`` or the first trial of the study. Once
                the search space is determined, it cannot be changed afterwards.

        independent_sampler:
            A :class:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler` instance that is used for independent
            sampling. The first trial of the study and the parameters not contained in the
            relative search space are sampled by this sampler.

            If :obj:`None` is specified, :class:`~optuna.samplers.RandomSampler` is used
            as the default.

            .. seealso::
                :class:`~optuna.samplers` module provides built-in independent samplers
                such as :class:`~optuna.samplers.RandomSampler` and
                :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler`.

        warn_independent_sampling:
            If this is :obj:`True`, a warning message is emitted when
            the value of a parameter is sampled by using an independent sampler.

            Note that the parameters of the first trial in a study are sampled via an
            independent sampler in most cases, so no warning messages are emitted in such cases.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``qmc_type`` is not one of 'halton' an 'sobol`.

    .. note::
        Added in v2.x.0 TODO(kstoneriv3)as an experimental feature. The interface may change in
        newer versions without prior notice.

    Example:

        Optimize a simple quadratic function by using :class:`~optuna.samplers.QMCSampler`.

        .. testcode::

            import optuna


            def objective(trial):
                x = trial.suggest_float("x", -1, 1)
                y = trial.suggest_int("y", -1, 1)
                return x ** 2 + y


            sampler = optuna.samplers.QMCSampler()
            study = optuna.create_study(sampler=sampler)
